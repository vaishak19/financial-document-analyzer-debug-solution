# financial-document-analyzer-debug-solution

agents.py

1) - llm = llm is invalid (undefined). Agents need a valid llm object, you should provide or initialize an LLM in your environment and pass it in (I show a         placeholder pattern).

2) - Agents’ goals/backstories were purposely malicious (hallucination encouragement). I rewrote them into professional, safe roles.

3) - tool=[FinancialDocumentTool.read_data_tool] was a wrong param name and may not match what crewai.agents.Agent expects (I used tools= which is typical). If your library uses a different parameter name, adapt accordingly.

4) - Removed instructions to make up advice; instead added explicit "informational only" disclaimers.

app.py(main.py)

1) - Endpoint function analyze_financial_document shadows the imported Task variable analyze_financial_document from task.py. This causes name collision and runtime issues. I renamed the endpoint function to analyze_endpoint.

2) - run_crew had a file_path parameter but did not include the file path in the kickoff input dict. Fixed to pass file_path.

3) - financial_crew.kickoff({'query': query}) — now includes file path and uses synchronous/asynchronous rules that better match typical SDK patterns.

4) - Added clearer error messages and small cleanup improvements.

5) - I added verifier and risk_assessor into the crew so the document can be validated and risk-summarized.

tasks.py

1) - Task descriptions intentionally asked for hallucination and fake URLs. I rewrote the tasks to be realistic: focused, constrained, and safe.

2) - Tasks were all using financial_analyst agent; I distributed tasks to appropriate agents and removed unsafe language.

tools.py

1) - Pdf(file_path=path).load() referenced an undefined Pdf. The code must use a PDF loader. I implemented a simple reader using pypdf (lightweight) to read text from every page — it's synchronous and robust.

2) - read_data_tool was defined as an async def inside the class without self or @staticmethod. I converted to a @staticmethod synchronous method for simplicity.

I also implemented a simple double-space cleanup in the InvestmentTool and kept placeholders for further analysis.
